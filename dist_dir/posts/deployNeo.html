        <h2>Deploying to Neocities via GitHub Actions</h2>
        <p>Wanted to write up a small tutorial for anyone not using node. Based on <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/deploy-to-neocities" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>,
        but for people not using NodeJS to make their site.
        </p>
        <p>
            You need to do 3 main things:
            <ul>
                <li>Make a folder to put your website stuff in (dist_dir)</li>
                <li>Make a folder to put in your deploy.yml file (.github/workflows - 2 folders)</li>
                <li>Get an API Token for your neocities site</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Making a Folder for your Website Stuff</h3>
        <p>
            I assume you have somewhere you've been writing your site if you want to deploy from GitHub, so go there.
            I made this one using VSCode, so I'll explain how to do it in there. Make a folder, title it whatever you want (mine is called
            'dist_dir'), and then put everything related to your site in that folder. This will be everything that gets pushed to Neocities.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do this because we don't want all the git stuff getting pushed to Neocities. We just want our website stuff!
        </p>
        <h3>Getting an API Token</h3>
        <p>
            Go to your neocities account, Account Settings > Manage Site Settings > API > Generate API Key. Copy this and DO NOT PUT
            IT ANYWHERE IN YOUR CODE. ONLY YOU SHOULD HAVE THIS. DON'T PUSH IT TO YOUR REPO!!
        </p>
        <p>
            Go to your GitHub repo > Settings > Secrets And Variables > Actions. Make a new secret, name it 'NEOCITIES_API_TOKEN' and paste your secret in the box below.
            Save it.
        </p>
        <h3>Making A deploy.yml File</h3>
        <p>
            Okay, so for this one, go back to your favorite code editor. Make a folder called '.github', then in that folder, make another folder
            called 'workflows'. In the workflows folder, made a file called 'deploy.yml'. It doesn't <i>have</i> to be called deploy.yml, it can 
            be anything.yml, but I called mine deploy.yml. The example file in the linked tutorial uses NodeJS, so we're going to use an edited version 
            I made. Here is <a href="https://github.com/bladetyr/Blade-Blog/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml" target="_blank">my deploy.yml</a>. The only thing you have to do 
            is change the "dist_dir:" line (the one at the end) to the name of your website stuff folder. Mine is just 'dist_dir' again, but if yours 
            is called 'mystuff', then the last line would look like "dist_dir: mystuff"!
        </p>
        <h3>Push Your Changes to GitHub</h3>
        <p>
            Alright, now push all of your changes to GitHub and it should start building! If you go to your GitHub repo > Actions > Deploy to neocities (on the left side of the screen),
             you should see it building (yellow) or built (green). If you go to your neocities url, you should see your site appear there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your website will rebuild every time you push to that repo, so, now you don't have to do anything to update your neocities site other than push your code :D if you have any questions, 
            you can message me on Discord. My username is blade.py
